Description: A set of functions to prepare data models and configurable models 
    for the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART; 
    smartconservationtools.org/) Conservation Areas, retrieve data from SMART
    data and configurable models (e.g., keys, categories, attribute
    names, and options per list or multilist attribute), and load the output
    of queries of specific Conservation Areas that are stored in SMART Connect. 
    The output of the queries can be loaded as spatial data or csv depending on 
    the query properties. The package also contains a function to identify the 
    queries available in SMART Connect per Conservation Area, the properties of
    each specific query, and per query folder. This information is necessary to
    properly identify the output options available for each query.
