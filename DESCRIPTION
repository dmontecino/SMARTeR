Description: A set of functions to create a species attribute from a csv, 
        for the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART; 
    smartconservationtools.org/) Conservation Areas, load the output
    of queries of specific Conservation Areas from SMART Connect, get information
    of each query in each Conservation Area the uer has access to (this is 
    necessary to run the query in SMART Connect and get the output), and get the 
    structure of a Configurable Model as a flat table (with tree attributes up to 
    two levels for now).
